## Hi there 👋

I'm Amaru, I study Computer Science at DCU.

So far I've been using gitlab so this is a bit new to me but here you can find some of the projects I've worked on.

Anyways, that's enough yap. 
Be nice, it's free.

And in case I don't ya, good afternoon, good evening, and good night!😵‍💫
